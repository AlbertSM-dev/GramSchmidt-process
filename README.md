# GramSchmidt-process

The Gram-Schmidt process is a method for constructing an orthonormal  basis of a space that a set of given vectors span. It can also be used  to determine the dimension of that space, which may be different than  the dimension of the vectors themselves or the number of vectors provided to span the space.

In  this assignment, you will complete a program that computes a  Gram-Schmidt basis, and gives the dimension of a span of vectors.

Best of Luck!
